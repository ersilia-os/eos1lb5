Status: In progress
Title: Mycobacterium cell wall penetration
Description: Compendium of models to predict the likelihood that a molecule enters
  the lungs (from Valitalo et al, 2016), diffuses through the caseum lesions (from
  Sarathy et al, 2016) and finally permeates through the bacterial cell wall (from
  Janardhan et al, 2016, Radchenko et al, 2023, Lepori et al 2025). The models are
  classifiers built based on the referenced data, using author-informed cut-offs for
  permeation. This model complements MycPermCheck (eos8d8a) .
