Title: Mycobacterium cell wall penetration
Description: Compendium of models to predict the likelihood that a molecule 
  enters the lungs (from Valitalo et al, 2016), diffuses through the caseum 
  lesions (from Sarathy et al, 2016) and finally permeates through the bacterial
  cell wall (from Janardhan et al, 2016, Radchenko et al, 2023, Lepori et al 
  2025). The models are classifiers built based on the referenced data, using 
  author-informed cut-offs for permeation. This model complements MycPermCheck 
  (eos8d8a).
